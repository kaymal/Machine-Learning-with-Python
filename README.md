# Machine Learning with Python

1. [Preprocessing Data][1]

    Preprocessing data for Machine Learning.

2. [Supervised Learning - Classification][2]

    Classsification with _iris_ dataset using the _k-Nearest Neighbors_ technique.

3. [Supervised Learning - Regression][3]

    Linear Regression and Cross-validation with _Gapminder_ dataset.

4. [Supervised Learning - Regularization (Lasso and Ridge)][4]
    
    Lasso and Ridge Regression to avoid overfitting.

5. [Evaluating Model's Performance][5]
    
    Informative measures such as Confusion Matrix, Classification Report, Logictic Regression, ROC Curve and AUC to assess performance.
    
6. [Hyperparameter Tuning][6]
    
    A **hyperparameter** is a parameter whose value is not learned but set before the model fitting. This section includes Hyperparameter Tuning with _Grid Search_ and _Random Search_.
    
7. [Pipelines][7]

    Perform transformations and a final estimator sequentially.
